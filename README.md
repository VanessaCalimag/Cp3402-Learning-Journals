Content Insights:

It find it challenging to look for an appropriate theme that will work on the pages I created. Some elements are missing so I decided to use the simpliest theme (GeneratePress) which is almost does not contain blocks.

I experinced the importance of creating back-up file of the website. I initially installed All-in-One WP Migration because of the online tutorial I was watching. With the trial and errors I'm creating on the pages section I accidentally deleted the entire content of my startup site and was able to restore the back up file I saved on my desktop.

I also had difficulty displaying/loading the mp4 file I embedded on the homepage, I still have not found the solution after checking all the requirements (at least mp4 format, less tahn 16 MB in size, no other Plugins installed in my WP apart from the back-up one, and re-uploading file in Media Library). The solution I found is by uploading the video in YouTube and embbed the URL in WP.



Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

The biggest insight I learned for this practical are basically doing trial and errors to get the feel and looks that I'm after for my website, it is definitely not a drag & drop action which is what generally shown on alot of online tutorials. I still end up focusing on the lecture and Lynda recordings to start creating the website. 

I find it more effective to watch the entire learning video initially and do a re-run while simulataneously following the instruction.
